# Generate Data
Here I made a tool to organize [Arcensoth](https://github.com/Arcensoth/mcdata)'s generated registries.json
Where I make one folder to each key of that registry, and make one file with every entrie inside a values array

I do not include `minecraft:air` because I chose not to.

I chose a values array because sometimes it may be useful.
